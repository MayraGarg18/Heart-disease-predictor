**Project Overview: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

With the increasing prevalence of heart diseases, accurate prediction and prevention have become imperative. Leveraging the power of Machine Learning, we aim to enhance the accuracy of heart disease predictions, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.

**Project Details:**

- **Objective**: Predict the presence of heart disease in patients, addressing a vital classification problem in healthcare.

- **Dataset**: The analysis is based on a heart disease patient dataset. This dataset encompasses a range of parameters, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., along with binary labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

- **Data Processing**: Thorough data processing was undertaken, involving tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing features. This step ensures that the data is in a format suitable for training machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning algorithms were employed to achieve accurate predictions. Notable models include:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression

- **Evaluation**: The models' performance was rigorously assessed using appropriate metrics to ascertain their predictive efficacy. This ensures that the selected model is reliable and robust in making accurate predictions.

- **Kaggle Kernel**: The project was shared as a Kaggle kernel titled 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'. This platform allows for collaborative data science and provides a space for sharing insights and code.
